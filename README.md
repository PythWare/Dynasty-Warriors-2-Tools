# Dynasty-Warriors-2-Tools
These are GUI modding editors for Dynasty Warriors 2 I made, specifically for the US version of Dynasty Warriors 2. Credit goes to Michael, Passion Wagon, Aurvi, The Tempest, and myself for documentation on Dynasty Warriors 2. 

To use these editors you will need to place them in the same directory as your Dynasty Warriors 2 game, rename your game's file to "DW2.bin", have the icon files in the Icon_Files folder, and have the background PNG files in the backgrounds folder.

You need Python installed.

After you have Python installed, just double click main.py and then go from there. Make sure when using Stage Editor, Unit Editor, and Name Editor you click the submit value button before going to a different slot so that the values you mod are saved.

If you have any questions/issues then let me know on here, reddit, or the modding discord server.

Main Menu:

Stage Editor(supports custom battles, image shows what's able to be edited, most stages have unused slots by default so you can edit them to be usable in the stage editor, each stage supports 512 slots with each map being able to have a max of 4,608 units across the map):

Coordinate Guider(gives a visual guide of where units spawn, auto marks when ran in stage editor to show current positions of units part of the battle, you can also manually type x/y coordinates or click anywhere on the minimap to get the x/y coordinates to use for modding where units spawn):
