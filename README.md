# Dynasty-Warriors-2-Tools
Original Description:

These are modding editors for Dynasty Warriors 2 I made, specifically for the US version of Dynasty Warriors 2. Credit goes to Michael, Passion Wagon, Aurvi, The Tempest, and myself for documentation on Dynasty Warriors 2. To use these editors you will need to place them in the same directory as your Dynasty Warriors 2 game, rename your game's file to "DW2.bin", have the icon files in the Icon_Files folder, and have the background PNG files in the backgrounds folder.

You need Python installed. I suggest reading the text file because it has a thorough guide on using the editors.
